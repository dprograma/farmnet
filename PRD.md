# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for Farmnet

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for Farmnet, an agricultural fintech platform. The project is designed to address the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Nigeria by providing them with access to financing, markets, and essential services. The goal is to break the cycle of debt, enhance productivity, and improve the livelihoods of farmers. This platform will be built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## 2. Problem Statement

Smallholder farmers in Nigeria are critical to the nation's food security, yet they operate in a challenging environment characterized by:

*   **Limited Access to Finance:** Farmers struggle to obtain affordable credit for essential inputs like seeds, fertilizers, and technology, which hinders their productivity.
*   **Market Access Challenges:** Lack of direct access to profitable markets often forces farmers to sell their produce at low prices to intermediaries, leading to reduced earnings and significant post-harvest losses.
*   **Fragmented Value Chain:** Inefficiencies in logistics, storage, and processing result in a disconnect between farmers and buyers, creating price instability and food loss.
*   **Financial Exclusion:** Many farmers lack access to basic financial services such as savings accounts and insurance, making them vulnerable to economic shocks.

This combination of factors traps farmers in a cycle of debt and limits their potential for growth.

## 3. Solution

Farmnet will be a comprehensive digital platform that seamlessly connects the agricultural value chain, offering the following solutions:

*   **Access to Inputs:** A system for farmers to obtain financing for agricultural inputs at subsidized rates, with flexible repayment options after harvest.
*   **Access to Markets:** A marketplace that connects farmers directly with a network of buyers, including FMCGs, exporters, and processors, ensuring fair prices and a ready market for their produce.
*   **Logistics and Storage Services:** Integrated logistics and warehousing solutions to minimize post-harvest losses and enable farmers to store their produce and sell when prices are more favorable.
*   **Financial Services:** A suite of financial tools, including a savings scheme for farmers to build wealth and access to insurance products to mitigate risks.
*   **Data Services:** A repository of valuable market information, including real-time pricing, quality standards, and weather data, to empower farmers to make informed decisions.
