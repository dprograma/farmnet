The farmer and buyer dashboards look archaic. The dashboards do not have a navbar. They don’t have  menus (maybe vertical nabber) with tabs to perform certain things on the dashboard. There’s not profile/account management to update user profile, settings, delete account. There’s visibly no logout button/feature in them.
